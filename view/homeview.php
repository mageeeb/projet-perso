        <p>Word Search Solver
            Our dynamic Word Search Solver lets you enter in your entire board via copy and paste. You can then enter your word bank and the solver will find all your words. It can even find words not listed in the answer bank. Sometimes the longest words are the hardest to find!
            
            Some of the other things you can do at THE Word Finder: Create a customized crossword puzzle. Make a word search with a holiday theme. Generate writing prompts. Tired of losing in Words With Friends? Try the word descrambler, which can help you find the highest scoring words given your set of rack tiles. You can then choose to sort results by length or by score (scoring options for Scrabble and WWF). Users can also enter in known letters as an extra string. Thus, if there is a "G" on the board that you want to build off of, enter your letters as well as the "G" in the extra string field. Want to improve your scrabble score? Study the Scrabble Word Lists to improve performance during live gameplay. For specific WWF help, we have a Words With Friends Cheat available. Want to create your own wordsearch? Check out the Activity room for a bunch of cool other tricks. We introduced a random sentence generator as well, which can be split into sentences of different length. With word generators, we're able to leverage our resources to create a unique tool for brides and grooms at our wedding hashtag generator page. Couples can make a list of creative wedding hashtags. One of our favorite crossword sites is here. In addition, if you are looking for a cactpot solver for FFXIV, we've got you covered with another resource.
            
            If you're looking to create your own palindromes, you can use the Backwards Text Converter to help. The backwards text tool is also fun if you want to just send a friend or family member a "coded" text to decipher. If you want to find every word in the dictionary that starts with a certain letter, this site can give you an output of all those words. You can also find every word that starts with a string of letters, such as starting with "Qu" ending in "ness." There are almost a half-million words in the English language, and the average person knows less than 20% of those words. We try to help with a word unscrambler for the 80% any way possible.
            
            If you are a Boggle player, we have a tool that will solve your entire board. During the game click on pause, take note of all the letters in your grid and enter them into the Boggle solver. From there the solver will list out every possible word that can be made, and users make the decision which words to play in the 2 minute allotted period. Users can even sort by score or alphabetically, depending on which is more convenient. For instance, say there is a triple letter score on the M in your board: In this case you may want to sort alphabetically so you have access to all the words that start with M for additional points. If you play the mobile app Wheel of Fortune, we recommend this wheel of fortune cheats site. You can also create your own WOF puzzle with our wheel of fortune generator here!
            
            The dictionary/word list that we use is based on the SOWPODS list, but has been adjusted to add new words that Scrabble and WWF now find acceptable. Such additional acceptable words include "texting" and "zen." Please get in touch with us if you believe the site should include any additional words in our list. We will be constantly adding to the word list as well.
            
            New to the game are our mobile app game answers! We've started with a few and will keep posting more. Check out Word Connect answers, as well as Pictoword answers, and Word Crossy answers.
            
            Wordle has been especially popular this year! Check out our wordle solver above, as well as Lingle, our variation game on Wordle. We also have a Quordle Solver and Wordle Maker. Quordle is a 4 word variation of Wordle. The Wordle Maker allows you to create your own custom puzzles to challenge family and friends.
            
            In addition to English, we support multiple languages including German, Spanish, French and Italian. Check out our other languages that are available.
            
            If you have any issues, suggestions, ideas, or complaints, definitely get in touch with us via our contact form, Twitter, or Facebook. We love to hear from our users! Check out our latest tool where you can make your own Stranger Things Wall message! We even have a Hollywood Sign Generator that you can customize. You can also send us a tweet for support issues.

            If you are a Boggle player, we have a tool that will solve your entire board. During the game click on pause, take note of all the letters in your grid and enter them into the Boggle solver. From there the solver will list out every possible word that can be made, and users make the decision which words to play in the 2 minute allotted period. Users can even sort by score or alphabetically, depending on which is more convenient. For instance, say there is a triple letter score on the M in your board: In this case you may want to sort alphabetically so you have access to all the words that start with M for additional points. If you play the mobile app Wheel of Fortune, we recommend this wheel of fortune cheats site. You can also create your own WOF puzzle with our wheel of fortune generator here!

We will be constantly adding to the word list as well.
